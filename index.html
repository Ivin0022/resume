                    <p>
                        The app has about 15,000 daily active users. I've worked on the app from the initial
                        stages to the current version solving many issues along the way. The app was
                        reconfigured for working to scale resolving bottlenecks. Streamlining Monetization
                        efforts like subscriptions had a great impact on the app's revenue.

                    <h6>Chat System using Redis cache</h6>
                    <p>
                        Implemented a chat system using socket.io that is currently running in 2 production
                        apps. chat with features such as one-2-one, group. Can handle around 200+ users at a
                        time on a single ec2 instance. We used Redis as the hot cache, with a custom
                        write-behind implementation that would periodically transfer data back to the persistent
                        storage, Postgres in this case.

                    <h6>Firebase Auth library for Django</h6>
                    <p>
                        Made a library for Django which leveraged firebase auth as its backend for login and
                        sign-up, which eliminated the need for integrating different providers (Google login,
                        Facebook login) in the backend and decreasing development time. The lib would take the
                        token passed from the frontend and make a firebase admin request to firebase which would
                        confirm the validity of the token after the valid is confirmed the lib would then check
                        to see if a local user exists in the database, create on if an entry doesnâ€™t exist. The
                        library is currently used by multiple apps across various Industries.
